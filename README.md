# PathFinding Vision

Website link : https://abhiktech.github.io/pathfinding-vision/

Background :
Graph Theory, especially pathfinding algorithms have numerous applications in our day-to-day lives and even in complex applications such as Google Maps. Intrigued by the complexity but relevance of Graphs, I decided to build this project in React.

Algorithms Implemented :
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Djikstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm
