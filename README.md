# PathFinding Vision

Website link : https://abhiktech.github.io/pathfinding-vision/

Background :
Before I started working on this project, I realized that I wanted to implement something that had a real-world application. When I was learning data structures and algorithms, I came across Graph Theory, and I was intrigued. I was mesmerized by the complexity but also the practical applications of Graph Theory, especially path finding algorithms. Eager to master these concepts and showcase my understanding, I decided to develop this project using React.

Project Timeline :
It took me around 1 month to complete this project.
- 10 days to gain a strong grasp of Graph Theory
- 5 days to learn React fundamentals
- 15 days for coding, debugging, testing, optimizing, and documenting

Algorithms Implemented :
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Djikstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm

Challenges Associated :
- Graph Theory (along with Dynamic Programming) is arguably one of the harder sections of data structures and algorithms. It took a good amount of effort to master it within a restricted timeframe.
- As I did not have any prior working experience with React, I constantly came across issues during the development process. But thank god for stackoverflow! In general, React's confusing asynchronous programming and difficult component reusability constantly posed issues.

Result :
I am very happy with the way this project turned out. My goal was to not only develop a more practical and applicable project, but also to make it as interactive and accessible as possible, which I have endeavoured my best to accomplish.

I hope you enjoy this project. To report any bugs/recommendations feel free to contact me at :
